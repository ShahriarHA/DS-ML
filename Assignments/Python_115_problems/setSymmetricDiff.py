# 73. Set Symmetric Difference: Given two sets A and B, write a Python program to find the symmetric difference between the two sets (i.e., elements that are present in either set A or set B, but not in both) and print the result.

a = {2,4,7,8}
b = {3,9,7,5}

sd = a.symmetric_difference(b)
print(sd)
